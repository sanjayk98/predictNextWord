## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)

```

## Including Plots
\[
\begin{eqnarray}
P(w_{a}) & = & \frac{C(w_{a})}{N}\\
P(w_{a}|w_{b}) & = & \frac{C(w_{a},w_{b})}{\sum_{w_{b}}C(w_{a},w_{b})}\\
P(w_{a}|w_{b}) & \sim &  \frac{C(w_{a},w_{b})}{C(w_{b})}\\
\end{eqnarray}
\]
where N is the total number of words in the training set and c(·) denotes count of the word or word sequence in the training data 
The probability will be undefined for words which was never seen in corpus. We apply laplace smoothing as following for correcting probablity for unseen data
\[ \begin{eqnarray}
P(w_{a}) & = & \frac{C(w_{a})+\delta}{N+V*\delta} 
\end{eqnarray}
\]




```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

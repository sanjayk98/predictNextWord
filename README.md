# Data Science Capstone-Smart Keyboard
The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project you must submit:

    A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input 
    and outputs a prediction of the next word.
    A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter
